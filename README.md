# Optimal Team Selection for Fantasy Football (FPL)

This project aims to predict the best possible 15-player squad for a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) gameweek based on historical player performance, team difficulty, and match conditions such as home and away advantage.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Analyze past EPL seasons (2022–2024) to extract performance patterns.
- Build a machine learning model to recommend optimal squads.
- Incorporate constraints such as player budget, team limits, and position requirements.
- Create a user interface using Streamlit to make predictions and visualize results.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Streamlit** – for interactive UI
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for analysis and development
